# Database Schema Fix Solution

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing a SQLAlchemy/PyMySQL error:

```
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (pymysql.err.OperationalError) (1054, "Unknown column 'crawl_jobs.job_type' in 'field list'")
```

This error occurred when trying to query the `crawl_jobs` table because the database schema was missing the `job_type` column that was defined in the SQLAlchemy model.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Model Definition**: The [`CrawlJob`](models/crawl_job.py:11) model had a `job_type` column defined:
   ```python
   job_type = db.Column(db.String(20), default='crawl', nullable=False)
   ```

2. **Database Schema Mismatch**: The actual MySQL database table `crawl_jobs` was missing this column.

3. **Migration Issue**: While there was an Alembic-style migration file [`add_job_type_field.py`](migrations/add_job_type_field.py), it wasn't compatible with the project's direct PyMySQL migration approach.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created MySQL-Compatible Migration

Created a new migration script [`add_job_type_field_mysql.py`](migrations/add_job_type_field_mysql.py) that follows the project's migration pattern:

- Uses direct PyMySQL connections
- Checks if the column already exists before attempting to add it
- Adds the `job_type` column as `VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'crawl'`
- Includes proper error handling and rollback functionality
- Adds an index for better query performance

### 2. Migration Script Features

```python
# Key features of the migration:
- Column check before adding
- Proper default value ('crawl')
- Index creation for performance
- Error handling and rollback
- Idempotent operation (safe to run multiple times)
```

### 3. Execution

The migration was successfully executed:

```bash
cd ui-regression-platform && python migrations/add_job_type_field_mysql.py
```

## Verification

The fix was verified by:

1. **Original Error Resolution**: The SQLAlchemy error no longer occurs when querying `crawl_jobs` table
2. **Model Compatibility**: The `CrawlJob` model can now access the `job_type` field without errors
3. **Application Functionality**: The application can now properly track different job types (crawl, screenshot, diff, find_difference)

## Database Schema After Fix

The `crawl_jobs` table now includes:

```sql
CREATE TABLE crawl_jobs (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id INT NOT NULL,
    status ENUM('pending', 'running', 'completed', 'failed', 'paused') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
    job_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'crawl',  -- ← ADDED COLUMN
    total_pages INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    started_at DATETIME NULL,
    completed_at DATETIME NULL,
    error_message TEXT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    -- ... foreign keys and indexes
    INDEX idx_job_type (job_type)  -- ← ADDED INDEX
);
```

## Impact

This fix enables:

1. **Job Type Tracking**: Different types of background jobs (crawl, screenshot, diff, find_difference) can be properly tracked
2. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Better job management and monitoring capabilities
3. **Feature Functionality**: Screenshot capture, diff generation, and find difference workflows can now operate correctly
4. **Application Stability**: Eliminates the database schema mismatch that was causing application crashes

## Files Modified/Created

1. **Created**: [`migrations/add_job_type_field_mysql.py`](migrations/add_job_type_field_mysql.py) - MySQL-compatible migration script
2. **Existing**: [`models/crawl_job.py`](models/crawl_job.py) - Model already had the field defined
3. **Existing**: [`app.py`](app.py) - Application code that uses job_type field

## Future Considerations

1. **Migration Strategy**: Consider standardizing on either Alembic or direct SQL migrations for consistency
2. **Schema Validation**: Implement automated schema validation to catch such mismatches early
3. **Testing**: Add database schema tests to prevent similar issues in the future

## Usage

The `job_type` field supports the following values:
- `'crawl'` - Standard website crawling jobs
- `'screenshot'` - Screenshot capture jobs
- `'diff'` - Visual diff generation jobs
- `'find_difference'` - Unified find difference workflow jobs

Example usage in code:
```python
# Creating different job types
crawl_job = CrawlJob(project_id=1)
crawl_job.job_type = 'screenshot'

# Querying by job type
screenshot_jobs = CrawlJob.query.filter_by(job_type='screenshot').all()

# UI Regression Platform

A comprehensive web application for automated UI regression testing that crawls websites, captures screenshots, and generates visual diffs between staging and production environments.

## 🚀 Current Status

**✅ PRODUCTION READY** - All core features implemented and race conditions eliminated.

### Phase Completion Status
- **✅ Phase 1**: Basic project management and crawling
- **✅ Phase 2**: Enhanced crawling with job queue management  
- **✅ Phase 2.5**: Advanced job control (pause/resume/stop)
- **✅ Phase 3 Stage 1**: Screenshot capture system
- **✅ Phase 3 Stage 2**: Visual diff generation
- **✅ Critical Fix**: Race condition elimination (August 2025)

## 🔧 Recent Critical Fix - Race Condition Eliminated

### Problem Solved
Fixed a critical race condition where completed crawl jobs were incorrectly marked as "failed" in the frontend despite successful completion in the database.

### Root Cause
- Jobs completed successfully but were removed from `running_jobs` with a 5-second delay
- During this delay, cleanup logic incorrectly marked completed jobs as failed
- Frontend showed "failed" status despite successful database completion

### Robust Solution Implemented
1. **Atomic & Idempotent Completion** - Database-level atomic updates
2. **Correct Order of Operations** - DB completion before cache removal
3. **Safe Orphan Cleanup** - 10-minute grace period with strict conditions
4. **Comprehensive Testing** - Race condition scenarios verified

**Files Modified:**
- [`models/crawl_job.py`](models/crawl_job.py) - Atomic completion method
- [`app.py`](app.py) - Correct order of operations
- [`crawl_queue/routes.py`](crawl_queue/routes.py) - Safe orphan cleanup

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components
- **Flask Web Application** - Main application framework

- Chrome/Chromium browser (for screenshots)

### Installation

1. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   cd ui-regression-platform
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create MySQL database
   mysql -u root -p
   CREATE DATABASE ui_diff_dashboard;
   
   # Run migrations
   python setup_mysql.py
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env with your database credentials
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_NAME=ui_diff_dashboard
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```

4. **Start Application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access Application**
   - URL: http://localhost:5001
   - Demo credentials: username='demo', password='demo123'

## 📋 Usage Workflow

### 1. Create Project
- Add project with staging and production URLs
- System validates URL format and accessibility

### 2. Crawl Websites
- Click "Start Crawl" to discover matching pages
- Real-time progress monitoring with pause/resume/stop controls
- **Race-proof completion** ensures accurate status reporting
